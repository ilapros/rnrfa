#' This function retrieves Gauged Daily Flow (gdf).

#' @description Given the station ID number(s), this function retrieves data
#' (time series in zoo format with accompanying metadata) from the WaterML2
#' service on the NRFA database. Gauged Daily Flow is measured in \eqn{m^3}/s.
#'
#' @param id station ID number(s), each number should be in the range
#' [3002,236051].
#' @param metadata Logical, FALSE by default. If metadata = TRUE means that the
#' result for a single station is a list with two elements:
#' data (the time series) and meta (metadata).
#' @param cl (optional) This is a cluster object, created by the parallel
#' package. This is set to NULL by default, which sends sequential calls to the
#' server.
#' 
#' @return list composed of as many objects as in the list of station ID
#' numbers. Each object can be accessed using their names or index
#' (e.g. x[[1]], x[[2]], and so forth). Each object contains a zoo time series.
