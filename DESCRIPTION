Description: Utility functions to retrieve data from the UK National River
    Flow Archive (<https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/>, terms and conditions:
    <https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/costs-terms-and-conditions>). The package
    contains R wrappers to the UK NRFA data temporary-API. There are
    functions to retrieve stations falling in a bounding box, to generate
    a map and extracting time series and general information. The package
    is fully described in Vitolo et al (2016) "rnrfa: An R package to
    Retrieve, Filter and Visualize Data from the UK National River Flow
    Archive"
