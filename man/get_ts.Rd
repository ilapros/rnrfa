\title{This function retrieves time series data.}
\usage{
get_ts(id, type, metadata = FALSE, cl = NULL, full_info = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{station identification number(s), each number should be in the
range [3002,236051].}

\item{type}{The following data-types are available:
\itemize{
  \item gdf = Gauged daily flows
  \item gmf = Gauged monthly flows
  \item ndf = Naturalised daily flows
  \item nmf = Naturalised monthly flows
  \item cdr = Catchment daily rainfall
  \item cmr = Catchment monthly rainfall
  \item pot-stage = Peaks over threshold stage
  \item pot-flow = Peaks over threshold flow
  \item gauging-stage = Gauging stage
  \item gauging-flow = Gauging flow
  \item amax-stage = Annual maxima stage
  \item amax-flow = Annual maxima flow
}}

\item{metadata}{Logical, FALSE by default. When metadata = TRUE the
result for a single station is a list with two elements: data (the time
series) and meta (metadata).}

\item{cl}{(optional) This is a cluster object, created by the parallel
package. This is set to NULL by default, which sends sequential calls to the
server.}

\item{full_info}{Logical, FALSE by default. If full_info = TRUE, the function
will retrieve information on rejected periods.}
}
\value{
list composed of as many objects as in the list of station
identification numbers. Each object can be accessed using their names or
indexes (e.g. x[[1]], x[[2]], and so forth). Each object contains a time
series of class \code{zoo/xts}.
}
\description{
Given the station identification number(s), this function
retrieves data (time series in zoo format with accompanying metadata) from
the WaterML2 service on the NRFA database. The time series can be of two
types: \code{cmr} (catchment mean rainfall, monthly) or \code{gdf}
(gauged daily flows, daily).
}

\dontrun{
  get_ts(18019, type = "cmr")
  get_ts(c(54022,54090,54091), type = "cmr")
  get_ts(18019, type = "gdf")
  get_ts(c(54022,54090,54091), type = "gdf")
  plot(get_ts(id = 23001, type = "ndf"))
  plot(get_ts(id = 23001, type = "nmf"))
